    description:
      "Police forces use the definition: “Anyone whose whereabouts cannot be established will be considered as missing until located and their wellbeing or otherwise confirmed. This means that if you are expected to be at home and aren’t there, or haven’t arrived at somewhere you’re supposed to be, you may be reported missing.”",

      "It could be someone at home; a family member or carer. It could be someone who was expecting to see you or hear from you, like an employer, colleague, friend or relative. Or, it could be a professional who has been helping you, like a keyworker, social worker or mental health worker.",

    title: "How do I stop being missing?",
    description:
      "To stop looking for you as a missing person, the police need to see you in person to do a ‘Safe and Well Check’. Once this is done they will close the investigation. This check can be done by any police officer – it doesn’t need to be in the place you went missing from. So if you are in a different town or city, you can go to a local police station or approach an officer if you see one in public.",

    title: "I’m not missing, so why are they looking for me?",
    description:
      "The police will be looking for you because nobody knows where you are, so they need to check that you are okay. Sometimes, there may have been a mis-understanding that led to someone reporting you missing. We can help you to sort things out with the police.",

    title: "When to report missing person?",
    description:
      "Section 90 of the Nigeria Police Act, 2020 mandates that when someone goes missing, a report should be filed WITHIN 24 hours at the nearest police station when their whereabouts are unknown. This should preferably be done by someone close to the person who is missing. This is because they would be in the best position to respond and provide all the information required by the police to carry out an investigation. ",
