    description: `Of course, this depends on the person you are looking for. Looking for a young child, or adult who is unable to care for themselves, will be very different to searching for someone who would be at work or school, or who is able to travel.
        Use your gut instinct. If you are seriously worried or you know they canâ€™t take care of themselves, react quickly and call your local authority. If you feel you can make some searches yourself and spend some time looking for them, do this first:
        ðŸ‘‰Check their home and places where you expect they might be.
        ðŸ‘‰Look for any notes, messages or emails from them.
        ðŸ‘‰See when they were last on social media or messaging apps.
        ðŸ‘‰Send them a message explaining how worried you are.
        ðŸ‘‰Ask friends, neighbours, and family to help you â€“ they might have heard from and not realised you are worried.
        ðŸ‘‰Write down what you have done to look and the times, so you can let police know if you need to.
